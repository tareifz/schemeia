# Schemeia (WIP)

A color shceme generator (for your editor). The basic idea of this tool is to be able to generate color schemes randomly and adjust the color if you want, but the first version will allow you to adjust the colors, and the new version will be able to generate random schemes.

I'm creating this project to learn [Svelte](https://svelte.technology/ "Svelte") and [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.technology/ "Sapper") expect many changes.
